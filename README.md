## Getting Started

* Create a new Cloud9 workspace. Note that most plugins assume a workspace based on the CS50 template.
* Clone this repo into ~/.c9/plugins/ (for example, the directory structure for the Simple plugin should be `~/.c9/plugins/cs50simple`)
* Run your workspace with: http://ide.c9.io/user/workspace?sdk=1&debug=2
