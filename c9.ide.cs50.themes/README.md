# CS50 Toggle Themes Plugin

This plugin (**cs50.themes**) adds a simple toggle button to the Preview bar 
that toggles the theme between night/day skins. There is a current bug in which
changing from "flat-dark" skin to "flat-light" skin causes the Preview bar to
slightly shrink. Reloading the IDE fixes it, and it is Cloud9 related.
